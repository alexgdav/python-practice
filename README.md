### Python exercises and mini-projects I've completed (for practice and reference)

####  1. PWGEN.PY:
Run in terminal (python3 pwgen.py)
Enter # of desired passwords & desired length (same for each of the desired passwords) to generate simple passwords.

#### 2. GUESSNUM.PY:
Run in terminal (python3 guessnum.py)
The script will have chosen a whole number between 1 and 20 upon being run. Enter a guess, find out if you're correct, and get the answer.
